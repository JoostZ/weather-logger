#summary USB HID Library

= Introduction =

The WS4000 uses the HID USB interface for communication with the PC. This page describes the implementation of the USB driver used in the wesather-logger project.

The implementation is heavily based on this [http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/USB_HID.aspx codeproject article]. In fact all the low-level code is taken directly from that implementation. The high-level interface is still based on that article but slightly generalized and extended with the WS4000 specific interface.

In the source for our project I have split the USB interface in two separate libraries.
  * The `UsbLibrary` is basically the [http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/USB_HID.aspx codeproject] implementation.
  * The `WeatherLoggerLib` contains the WS4000 specific extensions to `UsbLibrary`.

At the heart of the library is the (abstract) class `HIDDevice`. This class implements all of the low-level interfacing to a HID USB device.
